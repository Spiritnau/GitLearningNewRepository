I added second part of the task for the MODULE 8: LEARNING GIT AND GITHUB

sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny

MArch as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

MArch as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
